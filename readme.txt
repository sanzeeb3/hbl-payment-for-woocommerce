Adds Himalayan Bank Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

### HIMALAYAN BANK PAYMENT GATEWAY PLUGIN V2

Accept the Himalayan Bank payment from your store.

> <strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />
> PHP Version 8 or above.
> PHP [Sodium Extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sodium.php).

The plugin simply doesn't work if the above requirements aren't met.
 
Follow [the testing instructions](https://sanjeebaryal.com.np/accept-himalayan-bank-payment-from-your-woocommerce-site/#testing).


### Intro
[Himalayan Bank Limited](https://www.himalayanbank.com/) is one of the largest private banks of Nepal. If you do not know about the Himalayan Bank, you probably do not need this plugin.

Developer of this plugin is not associated with Himalayan Bank in anyway. 

You can get this plugin FREE and setup yourself by following the [step by step documentation](https://sanjeebaryal.com.np/accept-himalayan-bank-payment-from-your-woocommerce-site/).

I beleive that you needn't hire a developer to accept Himalayan Bank payment on your WooCommerce store.

Namaste!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the payment status remains at "Processing"? =

That's fine. "Processing" doesn't mean it's processing payment -- it means it's being processed/fulfilled by the site owner. [Read More](https://sanjeebaryal.com.np/why-is-my-woocommerce-order-status-always-processing/)

= The plugin is awesome. Can I contribute?

Yes, join the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sanzeeb3/hbl-payment-for-woocommerce). Contributions of any kind are welcome, not just the codes.
