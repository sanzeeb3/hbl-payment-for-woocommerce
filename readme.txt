Adds Himalayan Bank Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

### HIMALAYAN BANK PAYMENT GATEWAY PLUGIN V2

Accept the Himalayan Bank payment from your store.

> <strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br />
> This is Himalayan Bank Payment version 2. v1 doesn't work anymore..
> This is a early (beta) version of v2. Perform various testings before using it in production sites.

### Requirements
* PHP version 8.0 or higher. The plugin simply doesn't work on older PHP version.
* PHP [Sodium Extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sodium.php).
* Merchant ID (Office ID) & API Key. Contact bank for these information.

### Intro
[Himalayan Bank Limited](https://www.himalayanbank.com/) is one of the largest private banks of Nepal. If you do not know about the Himalayan Bank, you probably do not need this plugin.

Developer of this plugin is not associated with Himalayan Bank in anyway. 

You can get this plugin FREE and setup yourself by following the [step by step documentation](https://sanjeebaryal.com.np/accept-himalayan-bank-payment-from-your-woocommerce-site/).

I beleive that you needn't hire a developer to accept Himalayan Bank payment on your WooCommerce store.

Namaste!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the payment status remains at "Processing"? =

That's fine. "Processing" doesn't mean it's processing payment -- it means it's being processed/fulfilled by the site owner. [Read More](https://sanjeebaryal.com.np/why-is-my-woocommerce-order-status-always-processing/)
